You find an account by one Olric Steinenbach of the Fall of Ostoria.
Specifically, the account details the Battle of Ostoria and the last flight of the Vonindod.

//The mightiest of the empirial constructs, if one can even name the Vonindod as such, plumetted from the heavens as if it were a stone cast by the gods themselves.//
//With shrieks of terror the wyrms dispersed, but their retreat was in vain!//
//The Vonindod's fists were as mountains, its vision burned with the fire of the sun.//
//With a mighty swing it's sword cleaved swaths of them with each swing.//

//There were too many...//
//Though the Vonindod's power was unmatched, its energy was finite, and drained our empirial mages.//
//Slowly the colossus, and our beautiful city, was overwhelmed.//
