====== Calling Horns ======
Created Friday 13 March 2020

**history:** Calling Horns was nothing more than a trailside inn until a few years ago when [[:Tamalin Zoar]] , a famous adventurer and noble bought the establishment and retired here.

__Small village build mostly of mud-brick houses with thatched roofs.__
__Calling horns stands where Jundar's Pass meets the Evermoor Way. The intersection in the center of town is marked by a cairn fo weathered and lichen-covered ettin and troll skulls that have cemented together to form quite a sturdy structure.__

__The Calling Horn Inn is the only stone building, looming large over the village on a small bluff to the south.__
__The inn is surrounded by tall old trees and smells piney, like a well-aged scotch.__

The inn is in fact famous for it's scotches and ales and sports quite the collection.

Tamalin charges the local farmers and traders tithes. This is really a protection racket.
  However most of the villagers are happy to pay since Tamalin does keep the village relatively safe from the **trolls** and other beasts that constantly pour out of the [[:Evermoors]]

===== Encounter =====
If the party stays the night, they are awakened by a scritch-scratching racket.
2 trolls are trying to claw their way into the stables to feast on the horses inside.

The trolls are abnormaly hungry and fight to the death.
One of them has a white wolf's head gowing out of its shoulder. 
  The wolf's head is a winter wolf's head and does it's cold breath on the troll's initiative
	Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6): The wolf exhales a blast of freezing wind in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


==== Developments ====
Once the trolls are defeated, Tamalin reveals to the characters that troll attacks are becoming more common.
  She offers to give the party a letter that will grant the party good favor with the [[:Hand of Yartar]]  in [[:Yartar]] or [[:Harpers]] in [[:Everlund]] if the party agrees to find out why the trolls are getting so aggressive and put a stop to it.

The trolls are being rounded up and enslaved by a female fire giant named Zaastrid.
  If the players explor the evermoors, after some encounters with trolls/etins, they find Zaastrid single-handidly brow-beating and chaining up 6 trolls.
  The trolls show obvious signs of fear and anger at Zaastrid as she leads them eastward.

If freed or convinced otherwise, the trolls will quickly band together and turn on Zaastrid who takes 3 of them with her.
  The remaining 3 attack the party, hungry for meat.
