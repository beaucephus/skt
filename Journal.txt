===== Session 0 190601 =====
**Setting: **
  Savage North in the Forgotten Realms setting but not 100% accurate to all the written lore.  Think of it like Tyler's version of the Forgotten Realms.
  Worldmap pinned in discord.
  If you like, pick a location for your character to be from.
  High Fantasy, magic is common.
  All the good-aligned races are common and won't experience much prejudice.  Typically evil-aligned races might be unwelcome depending on the location (half-orc,drow,duergar)
  Questions about setting?
**How do we want to play dnd?**
  Probably theater of the mind combat, not grid, but we'll see.
  Anything published by Wizards of the Coast is fair game (except racial flying). If you wanna play something homebrew, just let me know so I can check the balance and we'll make it work.
  Difficulty (combat, puzzles, plot)
  PC death
  Evil PCs
  Spell components
  I encourage players to come up with their own vocal components for spells and say them when casting!
  Percentage combat/dungeoneering/social
  I am still learning how to roll-play lots of characters.  Please bare with me. Roll-play scenarios may feel a bit off.
  I don't usually do crit fumbles for attacks, but will try to remember to use them for this group.
  Crit fail/success on skill checks doesn't mean you'll fail the check. 1 means something negative happens, 20 means something positive happens regardless of the check.
  Questions about game mechanics or play style?
