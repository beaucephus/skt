__Two establishments stand out, a rustic inn posted the Gilded Horseshoe, and a closeby festhall, unmarked.__

If the party visits Longsaddle, they see a __wanted poster beraring a charcoal sketch of a dwarf with dark hair and a mad gaze, under which are written the words in common: "Let justice be done! The Marchion of :Mirabar hereby offers 5,000 gold pieces for the capture of the brigand :Worvil Forkbeard , known from :Luskan to Mirabar as the :Weevil . Last seen aroudn the Mines of Mirabar, the Weevil is wanted for theft and murder. He is armed and dangerous. Delver him to the Axe of Mirabar to receive payment."__
