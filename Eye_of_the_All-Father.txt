**history (let anyone who's studied giant history know)**
Giant legend tells of an oracle, a communication broker, to Annam the all-father himself that once existed deep in the spine of the world.
Millenia ago the lords and scholars of [[:Ostoria]] ventured to this oracle seeking knowledge and sometimes refuge.
Since the fall of Ostoria, there are few who still know even of its existence, much less its location.
