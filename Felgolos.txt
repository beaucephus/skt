====== Felgolos ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

**DC10 history**
You recall tales of a bronze-scaled dragon attacking [[:Zhentarim]] caravans and snatching their wagons, beasts of burden and all.
In fact, Felgolos has __quite the collection of Zhent wagons.__

Felgolos is an adult bronze dragon, known by his friends as __The Flying Misfortune__
He is clumsy in dragon form, and socially awkward, but he is good at heart.

**Upon departing with the party**
He says __I'd rather not stir with any more giants for a while__
He leaves for his lair which he tells the party is located in a cave overlooking a river that cuts through the western [[:Starmetal Hills]]
