====== Stone Stand ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020

DC10 **history** The Blue Bear tribe of Uthgardt barbarians is extinct, its spirit mound a haunted place best avoided.

__Stone Stand is situated upon a lonely hill north of the High Forest. Atop this hill stands the bear-claw-shaped mound of the Blue Bear tribe.__
__A towering oak tree grows in the center of the complex surrounded by a raised inner ring of cairns and a broken outer ring of mounds with more cairns atop them.__

===== Relic =====
The skull of a frost giant (Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants) is buried underneath the tree and the party will have to hack away at part of the tree's roots to access it.
Without the aid of magic, a single creature can take 40 hours to unearth the relic.

===== Encounter =====
Any time a creature approaches the tree the **ghost** of an Uthgardt barbarian appears next to the tree. up to 4 daily
They wail __"Why have I been denied a place at Uthgar's side?"__
__This ground is cursed!!!__
__The Lord of the Pale Giants!!!__
__Free us!!!__
Then they attack, first with their horrifying vissage, then possession and withering touch
