====== Morgur's Mound ======
Created Thursday 13 August 2020

__Morgur's Mound, the spirit mound of the lost Thunderbeast tribe stands in the crags, a land of rolling hills, plateaus, and sharp rocky outcroppings.__
From the gound or air __The mound is shaped like a crude, long-necked, wingless dragon. A ridge of dragon bones juts from the head, neck, back, and tail of the mound.__
__Enourmous cairs, each 30 feet in diameter encircle the mound out to a quarter-mile or more.__

**close to the mound**
__It seems this mound has been dug into. You see digsites around the entire perimeter of the mound.__

Patience is the key to finding the relice.
Without the aid of magic, it takes a single creature 8 hours digging to unearth something.
1. Potion of Fire Breath corked up with resin in a hollowed out animal horn
2. Elemental Gem of Yellow Diamond (__This roughly-cut yellow diamond trembles when touched. Upon further inspection you notice a small mote of shivering earth deep in the diamond's core. A crack runs the length of the jewel, likely compromising its structural integrity.__)
3. **Acient Relic: A gold-plated giant's tooth**. 

===== Encounter =====
When the tooth is lifted from the hole, the ground trembles as four thunderbeast skeletons erupt from the mound.
They fight until turned or destroyed
Each look and acts as an **ankylosaurus** with:
  vulnerability to bludgeoning damage
  they're undead
  they have darkvision

Any creature who destroys a thunderbeast skeleton is cursed.
Every step you take is accompanied with a thunderous boom.
You have advantage on intimidation checks
You automatically fail stealth checks.
