====== Flint Rock ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020

__Flint Rock, the spirit mound of the Elk tribe is situated in the midst of the Evermoors atop a gnarly knob of flinty stone that's perpetually shrouded in dense fog.__
__2 concentric, ring mounds encircle a central basin shaped like a leaping elk stag.__
__Menhirs mark the 4 cardinal directions on the inner ring.__
__In the center of the elk-like basin rests an elevated mound upon which sits a stone slab, several tons at least, 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet tall (at least that you can see)__

**On the ground**
__2 elk, possibly a mated pair, graze on the thick, lush moss and grass in the basin area.__


===== The Relic =====
The relic is a 75-pound, 5-foot-long mythral spear tip. It emits a faint aura of divination magic, though the magic has disappated and no longer produces any effects.
It is buried directly underneath the slab.
Creatures will need to either burrough underneath, move, or break the slab to reach it.
Combined strength check of 50 to move the slab

===== Encounter =====
**Elks**
They observe the party for signs of aggresstion, and go back to grazing if not threatened.
Any creature who kills an Elk on Flint Rock is cursed.
Members of the elk tribe recognize the cursed creature as a hated enemy and are hostile toward it.
In addition, the creature can't benefit from natural healing.
