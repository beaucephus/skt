[[Nightstone]]
Created Saturday 25 May 2019

Nightstone is a motte-and-bailey fortification built on the [[:Ardeep River]]

''After following the road for a few more miles, you hear the ringing of a bell. The sound grows louder as Nightstone comes into view. A river flows around the settlement forming a moat. The village itself is contained within a wooden palisade, beyond which you see a windmill, a tall steeple, and the high-pitched rooftops of several other buildings. Apart from the ringing of the bell, you detect no other activity in the village. The trail ends before a lowered draw-bridge that spans the moat on the western side of the village. Beyong the drawbridge, two stone watchtowers flank an open gap in the palisade.''
''South of the villae and also surrounded by the river moat is a cone-shaped, flat-topped hill on which stands a stone keep enclosed by a wooden wall. The keep, which overlooks the village, has partially collapsed. A wooden bridge that once connected the keep to the village has also partially collapsed.''

''A central lane opens up to the village square which is a large, open, muddy area marked by a covered well, empty carts, and a few tethering posts. Centered in the middle of the square is a 5ft cuboid hole. From the square you clearly see 2 marked buildings, The Squaking Squirrel, and the Lionshield Coster, among a host of other unmarked buildings. Behind one of the unmarked buildings, you see a grave-yard, around others, farms. To the south of the village, you see a tall windmill and the broken bridge spanning the moat up to the keep. Scattered all about the village are huge 500lb boulders and the wreckage wrought by their impacts. The impact craters and rubble make it seem as if the boulders had come from directly overhead.''

2 worgs slaughtered a dog and are feasting on its remains in the northeast corner of the village square.
