[[Nightstone]]
Created Saturday 25 May 2019

Nightstone is a motte-and-bailey fortification built on the [[:Ardeep River]]

''After following the trail for ten miles, you hear the ringing of a bell. The sound grows louder as Nightstone comes into view. A river flows around the settlement forming a moat. The village itself is contained within a wooden palisade, beyond which you see a windmill, a tall steeple, and the high-pitched rooftops of several other buildings. Apart from the ringing of the bell, you detect no other activity in the village. The trail ends before a lowered draw-bridge that spans the moat on the western side of the village. Beyong the drawbridge, two stone watchtowers flank an open gap in the palisade.''
''South of the villae and also surrounded by the river moat is a cone-shaped, flat-topped hill on which stands a stone keep enclosed by a wooden wall. The keep, which overlooks the village, has partially collapsed. A wooden bridge that once connected the keep to the village has also partially collapsed.''
