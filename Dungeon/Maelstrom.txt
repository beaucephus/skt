====== Maelstrom ======
Created Thursday 08 October 2020

Players that enter Maelstrom by teleporting always arrive at the circle in the Portal Chamber(2)

=== 1 Vortex and Sinkhole ===
__This naturally-formed sinkhole rises upward out of the reef where the tell-tale lighter blue of the open ocean can be seen. The sinkhole bottom is over 200 feet across and a rushing current of swirling water spirals downward into a 50-foot-wide grated drain. The seafloor surrounding the drain is strewn with debris - the remains of entire wrecked ships. 5 submerged passageways exit the sinkhole into the sorrounding coral reef. 50 feet about the sea floor, an uneven rocky ledge clings to the outer wall of the hole. 5 more flooded tunnels exit this ledge area into the surrounding reef.__

=== 2 Portal Chamber ===
**teleporting in for the first time**
__You apparate atop a glowing glyph carved into the floor of an alcove in the northeast corner of a 100-foot-diameter, rhough-hewn chamber. The chamber seems to be carved out of coral reef, the walls covered with bioluminescent lichen, snails, starfish, and barnacles. Tiny crabs crawl across the floor, avoiding the sigil. Across the expansive cavern you hear music: a powerful female voice accompanied by the deep, haunting tones of a masterfully played pipe organ. __
**upon entering the chamber**
__A 40-foot-diameter pool of water dominates the cavern. Identical 20-foot-wide hallways lead north and east respectively, while a much smaller cave leads south. The music seems to be emanating from an open archway which leads up a wide spiraling staircase.__
**pool**
__The waters are dimly lit by faint biolumenescent glow allowing you to see that the pool bottoms out 50 feet below you and twists into a submerged passageway heading southwest.__

=== 3 Small Guest Quarters ===
__Each of these 2 rooms contains furnishing sized for medium and small creatures: five comfortable beds, a circular rug, a barrel of drinking water, an empty dresser, and an empty wardrobe.__

=== 4 Giant Guest Quarters ===
__Each of these 2 rooms contains furnishing sized for giants.__

=== 5 Crab Pen ===
__A raised, barnacle-covered portcullis hangs above the entrance of this submerged cave. There are 2 huge piles of debris in the center. Several glints in the debris catch your eye.__

2 **hulking crabs**
They have shells covered in ship wreckage including lots of shiny things.
**loot**
All the crab legs you can eat

=== 6 Nym's Whale ===


=== 7 Coral Garden ===


=== 8 Mirran's Whale ===


=== 9 Sparring Chamber ===


=== 10 Sleeping Guard ===


=== 11 Serissa's Whale ===


=== 12 Sleeping Guards ===


=== 13 Study ===


=== 14 Great hall ===
__This circular room is split into 2 levels; a ground level, and a raised ledge in the northeast quadrant. __
__The ground level is an enormous audience chamber with tables carved from 30-foot-long conch shells. Barnacle-covered pillars of hewn coral rise to meet a vaulted cheiling. The tables and pillars are arranged in concentric circles surrounding a natural coral fountain in the center of the room that spews several streams of water into a shallow pool.__
__The raised ledge is stage set in front of a vast crystal window. The window acts like a prism for light filtering in from the surface, casting a rainbow of colors across the the chamber lighting the corals in reds, yellows, greens, and blues.__
__3 small exits lead west, northwest, and north. A 40-foot-wide halway exits to the south.__

There is a performance currently underway. Performing on the stage are 2 storm giant women; one singing, the other playing a hulking crab organ. In the audience chamber there are 2 storm giants standing guard at the ramps to the stage, and 4 other giants of different sub-races standing amongst the tables and listening.

=== 15 Throne Room ===
**Guarded by Tug and Cog**
Tug: __We guard throne room!__
Cog: __Where your escort?__

__Maelstrom's throne room resembles an amphitheater. Stone bleachers overlook an oblong chamber with a 50-foot-wide pool of seawater near its center.__
__Facing the pool and the arched entrance are 3 thrones. The middle and largest is carved from solid obsidian styled to look like dragon bones with clawed feet that are actual blue dragon skulls. The entire throne hovers 1 foot above the floor.__
DC 18 history to recognize the [[:Item:Wyrmskull Throne]]

**If they manage to get an audience or sneak in past Tug and Cog**
__An older matronly storm giantess sits on a smaller throne across from an old storm giant with a long white beard and clad in armor matching the guards, but with more.__
__In the hovering obsidian/dragon skull throne sits a young-adult storm giantess with blue hair tied up in a bun. The bun helps support a coral crown that otherwise would be too large for her.__
__2 storm giants stand guard on either side of the entrance, closing the door behind you.__

The 3 storm giants seems caught up in a heated argument as you enter. Their arguing ends abruptly as they notice you and the 3 turn to face you inquisitively.
