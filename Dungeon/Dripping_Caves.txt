====== Dripping Caves ======
Created Friday 31 May 2019

Gaping cave mouth on the south face of a rocky hill topped with pine trees enters to area 1.
If the characters take an hour to circle the hill, they find 2 other entrances.
  On the west side is a narrow tunnel into which a stream flows. This tunnel is 40ft long and enters to area 6.
  On the east side is a dry, 100ft long tunnel that gently slopes downward to area 3A.
If the characters climb the hill, they find a natural chimney (5ft diameter shaft) that descends 50ft to area 7.
  The chimney has abundant handholds. DC10 to climb without tools or fall to the bottom.

===== General Features =====
**Darkness: **The caves have no natural light source. The goblins and ogres use their darvision to see.
**Dripping Water:** Water constantly drips from the stalactities in the main chamber. The sound echoes throughout the complex but isn't loud enough to drown out other distinctive noises.
**Narrow Tunnels:** The tunnels leading away from the main cavern are 7-8ft high and range in width from 2-5ft. (Ogres and other large creatures can squeeze through)
**Walls:** The walls are damp and slick, but sport an abundance of nooks, crannies, and outcrops making for easy climbing. (DC 10)

===== 1. Main Cavern =====
Vast cavern with a forest of stalactites and stalagmites rising to meet them.
The floor is riddled with broken spears, broken shields, and bat guano.
An ogre is visible in the daylight bathing in a pool of mud near the entrance.
**darkvision:** Around the perimeter of the room there are 6 natural tunnel exits and 5 ledges upon each of which sits a single sleeping goblin.

If the party caries light or makes noise, the 2 ogres and 5 goblins across area 1 sound an alarm and all attack.
