====== Beorunna's Well ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020

__Beorunna's Well, the spirit mound of the Black Lion and Red Tiger tribes of Uthgardt barbarians rests in the heart of the Druarwood.__
__Not a mound per se, but an ice-cold cavern whose ceiling is partially open to the sky.__

**DC10 history**
According to Uthdardt legen, Beorunna, a barbarian hero died fighting a demon in these woods. In the final moments of the battle, the ground beneath Beorunna's feet crumbled, plunging her and her enemy into a cavern.
The cavern contained a heated pool that came to be know as Beorunna's Well

===== Above =====
__A long, knotted rope tied off to a tree trunk descends 250 feet down to the bottom of the open cavern. In the center of the cavern floor, where light can reach stands a small grove of furs and pines coated in snow.__

===== In the cavern =====
__The roughly triangular cavern floor is dotten with cairns and stalagmites. The walls rise up at an angle to the narow open ceiling.__
__Stalagtites and protruding tree roots make a jagged mess of the cavern's arched walls and ceiling.__
__A faint mist hangs in the cavern and the sound of lightly flowing, falling, and dripping water echoes throughout the cavern. __

===== At the center =====
__A small stand of pine trees like a sunken grove grows in the middle of the cavern.__
DC20 to notice an Uthgardt shaman sleeping under a blanket of snow.

**To the west**
__a 100-foot-diameter pool streams into the cavern walls through various cracks and tunnels.__
__A single geyser steadily erupts a fountain of water, creating a warming mist that spreads throughout the cavern, making any object further than 50 feet away seem fuzzy and not-well-defined.__

**To the east**
__You see the faint glow of light coming through the mist.__
DC20 to notice the smell of cooking meat wafting from the east.

**To the south**
__A multi-tiered ledge rises 100 feet above the cavern floor. Two branchless trees stand on the highest ledge.__

===== At the well =====
__On a rocky shore next to the spring, the ground is strewn with humanoid and animal bones - the obious remains of some monstrous creature's kills__
DC20 to notice one high, rocky ledge has signs of activity. Claw marks, tufts of fur, and more bones.

===== At the camp =====
__6 human barbarians huddle around a campfire speaking softly while cooking a small woodland deer on a spit. 4 wood and hide tents are put-up behind them.__

===== At the alter =====
Require a stealth check to climb the ledges without making noise.
__You can see now the 2 branchless trees are actually two separate totems. One pole is covered in black pitch upon which rests a large cave lion's skull. The other is covered in dried coagulated blood upon which rests an equally large tiger's skull.__
__At the highest level, near the back wall of the cavern sits a large stone slab, weighing several tons at least, it is 10 feet-long, 6-feet-wide, and 3-feet tall (at least that you can see)__
__It is spattered with dried blood and a rotting yak's corpse rests atop it.__

**Relic**
A rough-hewned niche underneath the alter contains the skeletal remains of a large humanoid, and a fossilized horn carved from mammoth tusk and engraved with images of giants battling dragons.
The horn weighs 250 pounds and is worth 750GP
Creatures will need to either burrough underneath, move, or break the slab to reach the niche.
Combined strength check of 50 to move the slab

===== Encounter =====
Any loud noise in the cavern echoes, waking the **manticore**, the **Uthgardt Shaman** in the grove, and the 4 **berserkers** and 6 **tribal warrriors** resting near the campfire.
**After a round or two**
The shaman __draws a large black pearl and begins attempting to crush it while frantically repeating a ritualisitc chant__ to cast Circle of Death once, requiring 3 turns to complete the spell.
Any remaining barbarians gain the effects of a Glamour bard's Mantle of Inspiration and attempt to protect her while she completes the spell.

**loot**
The shaman has a large black pearl worth 500GP unless she completes the Circle of Death spell
