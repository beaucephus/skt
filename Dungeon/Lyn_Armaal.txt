====== Lyn Armaal ======
Created Friday 11 September 2020

__Countess Sansuri's castle consists of three conjoined towers connected to a gatehouse landing via bridge, all made of smoothly mortared, stone. The central tower is the widest and has a more slender tower rising from its top that ends in a conical pinnacle, the highest point in the castle.__
__The flat roofs of the 3 main towers are coated in lush, green lawns dotted with gardens, fountains, and even a greenhouse.__
__The castle itself towers, from base to peak, several hundreds of feet atop a semi-solid cloud floating more than a mile above the earth below.__

**closer**
__Crenellated battlements surround every surface of exposed tower-top. Protruding from the battlements you can see many ballistae and a few telescopes.__
__Watchful cloud giant and aarakocra sentries stand guard along the battlements__

**if noticed**
__A single aarakocra flies up to the ship. He gestures for you to follow him.__

**If the party approach Lyn Armaal diplomatically**
