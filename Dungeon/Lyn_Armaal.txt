Marble bleachers hug the walls near the entrance, across from which stands an ornate alabaster throne inlaid with gemstones.

__Set into the floor in front of the throne is a 10-foot-diameter curcular hole surrounded by decorative tiles of gold marble, white alabaster, and blue lapis lazuli. Standing at attention with their backs to the hole are four aarakocra.__
The statues are harmless sculptures
The aarakocra are alert but remain perfectly still. They have been ordered to guard the throne. They take no action unless physically provoked or if the characters approach the throne.

A wooden table rests between two doors, and a rug embroidered with an image of the night sky lies on the floor.__

=== 5 Barracks ===
__5 beds are spaced along the outer wall, with a barrel of wine and a crate of food stashed in one corner. Three giant cloaks hang from bronze hooks on one of the walls, and resting by the door is a large chest.__
5 cloud giants are asleep in the beds at all times. (They are part of a guard rotation)
If woken due to an alarm, they go to the Aft Battery(6), then 2 each head to the ballistae in the other batteries(16 and 18). 1 stays behind in the Aft Battery(6)

Doors and stairs in the tower walls lead to various locations in the castle.__
2 cloud giants stand on the Rampart(17) and can see and hear into the courtyard. 5 rounds after an alarm has sounded, [[:Countess Sansuri]] , [[:Castellan Cressaro]] , and 5 cloud giants arrive here. After some instruction from Cressaro, the 4 of the guards disperse to the Starboard and Port Batteries. 1 stays behind.

5 griffons are locked up, one in each cage, unless Sansuri released them.
The griffons make a ruckus if they notice a creature enter the room. Sansuri hears them and comes to investigate.

__This spacious, windowless dungeon is furnished with 3 currently empty iron cages, and a rack of tortuous implements. A deep, pained whimper alerts you to the prescence of something huge tucked into the corner of the room.__
[[:Felgolos]] , an adult bronze dragon, is chained to the back wall and floor. He is bound by 4 locked manacles, a rune-covered collar around his neck, and a muzzle.
His bonds are strengthened my magic and require 30 strength per creature to even attempt to break them.
Felgolos' collar is magically enchanted to preven him from using his shape change.
Felgolos can speak with some difficulty.
He is bleeding from multiple wounds, some old, some fresh when the party finds him. (He's at 160 hitpoints)
Knock or DC20 thieves tools check to unlock one restraint

A small pantry holds various ingredients and spices. On a shelf below an open window are a half dozen freshly baked pumpkin pies.__
