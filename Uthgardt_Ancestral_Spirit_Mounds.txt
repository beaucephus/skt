Have every party roll a d10 to determine which mounds they know of. Reroll duplicates

===== Skill challenge to actually find the mound once they arrive in the general location. =====
__Weâ€™re starting a skill challenge to describe how you find__ X
__A skill challenge is a type of scene where the party needs to succeed on a certain number of ability checks before you reach 3 failures.__ __3 strikes and you're out.__
__We go to each person in turn, and on your turn, you set up a scene yourself, describe how you try to overcome it, then make a check to see if you are able to succeed.__
__You can only attempt a skill that you are proficient in and once you've used a skill, you can't use that same skill again, tho other characters can.__
__If the party gets enough successes, you reach your destination safely. If the party fails the skill challenge, something bad will happen.__

__The DC for this skill challenge is 13 and you need to reach 4 successes to overcome the skill challenge__

=== Examples: ===
**Nature**
__I use my studied knowledge of the area's local flora and fauna to gather some awareness-hightening herbs for the party to chew on as we travel.__
**Performance**
__We stumble upon a mother owlbear and cubs. I play possum to disinterest the owlbear until she goes away.__
