====== Nightstone ======
Created Friday 24 May 2019

__You've been traveling along the High Road for days. Early in the morning sun, you spot a wooden signpost next to a trail that heads north into the hills. Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked "Waterdeep" and "Daggerford" follow the High Road but point in opposite directions. The third, marked "Nightstone," beconds you to follow the trail. If your information is accurate, Nightstone should be roughly ten miles up the trail.__
