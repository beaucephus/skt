====== Nightstone ======
Created Friday 24 May 2019

Nightstone is a fortified settlement located a few miles south of the [[Ardeep Forest]] , in the untamed hills between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Daggerford]] .
A lonely wooden signpost, standing where the trail to Nightstone meets the [[High Road]] , points the way to the settlement.

Run [[Dungeon::Nightstone]] when the players first arive.
