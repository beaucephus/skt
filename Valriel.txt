====== Valriel ======
Created Thursday 30 May 2019

Valriel, also known as Val, is a servant knight to the master of strategy archdevil Bel. She's never known anything but combat and strife from the time she was a child. She doesn't know her father nor mother, but there was always Bel. 

Bel had adopted her, saw something in her, and raised her. Later, she discovered that her true parents belonged to a village that Bel had raided and that they were killed by his soldiers. It didn’t bother her much. She is a soldier now and understands the cost of war and duty more than anything else. Besides, she's only really ever known Bel as any sort of guardian. She worships his battle superiority and has become one of his most trusted Hell Knights. 

After hearing there was a commotion with giants in a region Tiamat once controlled Bel noticed this as an opportunity to take advantage of the chaos by bringing order with a single servant - Val. Val knows how to speak giant and has the fear potential to conquer an empire. He has sent her to bring order to this realm in his name while under the guise of bringing “peace” back to the land. Her true intention - to conqueror the entire region, push the giants back, and claim the land for Bel - will propel her to unknown heights and will be held close to her breast as her deepest secret.


===== Knight of Maelstrom =====
Valriel has been named a knight of the Maelstrom court. One of the knightly duties and perks is that you've been granted lordship over an area of the Trackless Sea from which you may raise a militia of storm giants. The giants in your area are listed in the handout I attached, should be 4. Keep in mind this is a militia and not a standing army. You have their morale, families, and livelihoods to consider when calling upon their help. You have a magical conch-horn which you can blow to call up the militia. They mount rocs and arrive at the location where you blew the horn as soon as they can given the roc's flying speed. They do as you bid unless your bidding is in direct conflict with the newly drafted constitution or Queen Serissa's wishes/mandates.
