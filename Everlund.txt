====== Everlund ======
Created Friday 13 March 2020

__Situated on the banks of the Rauvin River, Everlund is one of the North's most active mercantile communities. A thick stone wall encloses the entire city.__
__Gates line the wall in several places, once such gate lies directly before you. Beyond the now open gate, you see a wide city lane that cuts a direct path through to the center of the city.__


Once inside the center (Bell Market) : __5 total lanes cut straight paths out to the city walls like the spokes of a wheel. The streets are clean and well patrolled by the city's considerable standing army.__ (They keep a large army since they just recently left the Lord's Alliance)
__The buildings all around are stately and well-maintained. There are no slums to be seen for the entire expanse of the city.__
__The most prominent of the edifices in Everlund is a keep of black stone that rises from one of the higher knolls.__

At the Rauvin River: __Two strong-looking stone bridges span the Rauvin, which has parks and gardens along its shores.__


===== Moongleam Tower =====
__Black stone structure consisting of 4 cylindrical towers joind together by thin passages at several different levels. The keep is surrounded by a currently dry moat, though sleuce gates are readily visible and a small stream of water can be seen trickling out of each.__
__Crowining the roof is an open turret, where a 10-foot-wide mirror shaped like a crescent moon stands.__
