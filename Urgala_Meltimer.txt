Created Saturday 10 August 2019

A retired adventurer, Urgala owns a respectable inn, the Northshield House, and she doesn't want to see it or her neighbors' homes destroyed. She has no tolerance for monsters or bullies.

**ideal** We live in a violent world, and sometimes violence is necessary for survival.
**bond** My home is my life. Threaten it, and I'll hurt you.
**flaw** I know how treacherous and greedy adventurers can be. I don't trust them.
