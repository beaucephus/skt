====== Dragon Bonker ======
Created Monday 10 August 2020

This relic is a 14-foot-long, 250-pound dragon's thighbone. Part of the bone is wrapped in old leather, suggesting it might have once been used as a giant-sized greatclub.
The greatclub magically resized to fit it's wielder if attuned.

The greatclub is a magic weapon that deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage whenever it hits a dragon.
