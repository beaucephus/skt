====== Othovir ======
Created Saturday 10 August 2019

Othovir is a gifted harness-maker who doesn't talk about his family or where he came from.
He cares about his business, his clients, and his good name.

Othovir belongs to [[:House Margaster]] though he has cut all ties to his family because they secretly worship the arch-devil [[:Asmodeus]] and Othivir wants nothing to do with them.
