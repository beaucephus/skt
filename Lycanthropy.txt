====== Lycanthropy ======
Created Monday 10 August 2020

Any creature cursed with lycanthropy begins to develop subtle animalistic features like that of the animal that cursed them.

Any time the lycanthrope sees a full moon, or an image like a full moon, they must make a DC30 CON save or transform into a **werewolf** (or other appropriate were-animal).
All statistics are immediately and completely replaced with those of a **werewolf** and their alignment becomes chaotic evil for the duration.
The transformation lasts until dawn.
This DC decreases by 5 for every transformation the lycanthrope undertakes.
Upon the first successful save, the creature gains control over their primal urges, obtaining the ability to shape-change at will into either **werewolf** or **wolf** form. (works like druid beastshape)
