====== Lyn Armall Feast ======
Created Friday 11 September 2020

The party will be led to the Gate House where they are introduced to [[:Castellan Cressaro]]
The castellan will ask __What business have you with Lyn Armaal?__
He will escort the party to speak with [[:Countess Sansuri]] in the Audience Chamber

Sansuri greets the party as a welcoming host wearing her happy mask.
She expresses interest in the party and hears what they have to say.
If they express interest in Maelstrom, Sansuri dons a grim mask and asks why and for what reason should she bestow them the conch.
Regardless of whether they offer a good reason, a roar occurs

===== Muffle crashing and roars =====
Periodically the muffled roaring of a wild beast echoes throughout the castle. Sansuri waves it off as __The cooks are just preparing our evening feast.__
Sansuri offers to host the party for dinner

===== Retire =====
The party is able to retire to the guest quarters where they are prompted to __freshen up and__ __change into more appropriate dinner attire__ 
There is a giant-sized hot bath drawn, with soap. A number of of fancy silken robes laced and trimmed extravagantly are layed out on the giant-sized beds in the room.
A barrel labelled __Lyn Armaal 1426__ sits atop a table next to a decanter and goblets, all-giant-sized.
A cloud giant guard is stationed outside the Guest Room and attempts to keep them inside.
He is rough and short, seeming to offer the party no leniency, suggesting the __try the wine. It was made in our very own vinyard__.
Any creature that drinks the wine falls into a coma-like sleep after 10 minutes. The sleep lasts 1 hour.
After 30 minutes in the room, the guard enters the room to incapacitate any remaining wakeful party members. He might call for help.

**If he gets the party**
He takes them to the kitchen where they all wake up one hour later, stripped of their clothes, tied up with meat-string, and being seasoned for a stew.
There are various sharp implements lying around as the 3 ogres are not very organized cooks.
The party's gear is still in the Guest Room.


===== Now run the dungeon!!! =====
