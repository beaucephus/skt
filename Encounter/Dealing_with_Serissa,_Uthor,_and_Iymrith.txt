====== Dealing with Serissa, Uthor, and Iymrith ======
Created Sunday 15 November 2020

**Serissa: **__I think that giants and smallfolk can learn to coexist peacefully__
__My mother, before she passed, would take me with her on trips to the Sword Coast and the Moonshae Isles. The smallfolk there were kind and generous.__ She sounds still mournful.

Serissa's mother was found, murdered, on an island in the trackless sea. The scouts that found her found signs that smallfolk had moored in the area recently.

**Uthor: **__It would be unwise to trust these smallfolk based solely on their word__


**Iymrith: **__These lot can't be trusted. For all we know they could have been involved in your mother's murder. They might be here to finish off the royal family!__
If outed Iymrith issues a curse in draconic and snatches Serissa's necklace (it is a [[:Item:Korolnor Scepter]] ). Serissa collapses into paralysis until she is removed from the wyrmskull throne.
On her next turn she attempt to cast teleport or escape through the central pool.
