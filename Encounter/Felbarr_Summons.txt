====== Felbarr Summons ======
Created Monday 02 September 2019

[[:Citadel Felbarr]]

King Morinn and Queen Tithmel issue a summons for the party.
The King and Queen have heard of the party from [[:Ghelryn Foehammer]] and want to solicit the party to investigate some rumors that giants have been spotted near the ancient underground forge, [[:Ironslag]]
If the giants were to restart it, the forge being so close to the citadel would be a disaster and the giants must be routed before that happens.

In return the Kind and Queen offer to build the party a stronghold in the [[:Silver Marches]]
	100 days to build
	all costs and personnel paid for by the sovereigns. (10 Felbarr dwarve **guards**)
