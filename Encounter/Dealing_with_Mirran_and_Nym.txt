====== Dealing with Mirran and Nym ======
Created Sunday 15 November 2020

The sisters end their performance with the players appear.
The storm giant guards move to intercept the party, but the storm giantess with blue curls who was singing stops them. __Wait. How did you find this place?__
__What business could tiny creatures like you have at maelstrom?__
__The storm giantess with long wavy white hair looks your group over with a smile.__

**If the party is diplomatic**
Mirran: __Serrisa is young and inexperienced. She is far too overwhelmed with important matters to grant an audience to tiny creatures.__

If the party mentions dragons, Iymrith, or the oracle, the sisters look taken aback.  Allow a roll.
The sisters may call for Iymrith, go to speak with Serissa, or allow the party an audience with Serissa based on the check.
