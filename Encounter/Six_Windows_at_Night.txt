====== Six Windows at Night ======
Created Friday 11 October 2019

Early in the night, Tolmara will noisily spy on the party through the keyholes of their rooms.
Later in the night, the party hears a scuffling sound coming from the ceiling directly over their room.
The attic space is unlocked and shows no signs of entry even with thick dust covering the floors. 
If the party search the attic
	They find a large, wooden barrel in the space over their room. The dust of the attic looks to be a little disturbed around the barrel.
The barrel contains the bones a human male.

If the bones are touched
	They animate, turning into a skeleton for 1 round.
		The skeleton is unarmed and deals 1 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
	This effect repeats unless the skeleton is reduced to 0 hit points
	
The bones are the remains of Tolmara's late husband, **Mirak**.
Tolmara drugged him and sealed him in this barrel with a poinsonous snake.
Mirak professes not to know why she killed him. (DC 13 insight to realize he's hiding something)

Tolmara is too deranged and insane to remember the incident or circumstances leading up to it.
A restoration spell restores her sanity and she reveals that she murdered him because he was unfaithful to her.
	She is overcome with real grief
	She is afraid she'll be hanged and offers the party a [[:Item:Driftglobe]] if they promise not to report her crime.

If the party reports Tolmara's crime to Darathra
	The lord protector has Tolmara arrested and imprisoned pending a trial.
	Darathra also notifies Mirak's two brothers who work on a nearby farm.
	They give the party a [[Item:Driftglobe]] if Tolmara hasn't already given it.
