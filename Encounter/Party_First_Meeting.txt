====== Party First Meeting ======
Created Saturday 25 May 2019

''You've been traveling on the road for days.  ''
''Just after mid-day, you spot a wooden signpost next to a crossroads where the High Road meets with other winding trails.''
''Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked "Waterdeep" and "Daggerford" point towards opposite ends of the High Road.''
''The third, marked "Nightstone," beckons you to follow the trail leading north-east.''
''As your attention tracks down from the sign, you notice several other travelers have reached the intersection from other roads.''

Have the players describe their character's.
