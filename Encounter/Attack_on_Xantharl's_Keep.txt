Created Sunday 01 September 2019

This encounter takes place in [[:Xantharl's Keep]]

The half-ogre proprietor of the Falling Orc inn and tavern, Arzastra has recently taken pity on a coinless shield dwarf adventurer named "Larg"
She gave Larg food, shelter, and is paying him a few copper to keep the stables clean.
She thinks Larg is an unlucky adventurer who's party was killed by an avalanche while hunting a red dragon in the [[:Valley of Khedrun]]

In fact, Larg is [[:Worvil "the Weevil" Forkbeard]] , a wanted criminal.
Worvil recognizes [[:Tana Willowwhisper]] but keeps calling her "Frana". He thinks she is the woman who sent him and his team on his last job, [[:Frana Willowwhisper]]
He has the stats of a dwarf **bandit captain**

===== The Attack =====
A lone stone giant named Kaltivar, an older giant with pale-grey skin and a scoliose, stages an attack on the west side of the gate.
This staged attack is a diversion for the main objective which is to capture the Weevil.
  [[:Frana Willowwhisper]] convinced the stone giants that [[:Worvil the Weevil Forkbeard]] is to blame for the [[:Shattering of the Ordening]] .

A small army of 50 **goblins,** 10 **hobgoblins** and 5 **ogres** equipped with goblin huckers stage an attack on the western gate.
10 **bugbears** stealthily attempt to enter the eastern gate and capture the Weevil.

DC20 Insight to realize the attack is a ruse.
DC15 Passive Perception to hear fighting in the stables.

**Loot**
Kaltivar carries a sack containing 
	107gp of coin.
	A giant-sized bone comb
	3 adult white dragon scales

[[:Item:Deadeye]]


===== The Aftermath =====
Whether the bugbears are successful or not, their remaining members attempt to flee and report to Kaltivar.
Kaltivar and the goblinoid horde only execute their attack for an hour, making a slow, staged, event of the whole thing.

Arzastra can inform the players that they can collect the bounty on the Weevil with the  commander of the garrison, Narbeck Horn.
  Narbeck has a sending stone which he uses to commune with the Marchion of Mirabar.
  He will take the Weevil into his custody and pay the party the 5000GP bounty if the Weevil is delivered alive.
