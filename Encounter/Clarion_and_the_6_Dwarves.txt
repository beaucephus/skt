====== Clarion and the 6 Dwarves ======
Created Sunday 02 June 2019

Party encounters [[:Clarion]] , an **adult silver dragon**, who swoops down out of the sky and releases 6 heavily armored dwarves (**veterans**) from her front claws.
The dwarves immediately hail the players and lightly interrogate them about [[Encounter:Giants on the Road to Triboar]]
The dwarves are from [[:Mirabar]] , and are looking for a particular magic item that was being carried in the caravan.
  Remember the [[:Item:Sanctified Bones]] !!!

If the dwarves see [[:Item:Shalamayne]] they demand it returned.
__You can't even weild it properly!!!__

If the party is not negotiating well.... the dwarves might try to forcibly take the sword. Clarion advises against this repeatedly, only joining in with his frightful prescence and paralyzing breath.

If the party successfully negotiates with the dwarves, they disclose that Shalamayne only realizes its true potential in the hands of a dwarf [[:Item:Shalamayne]]
  otherwise Clarion might swoop down after the fight.
  He regrets the dwarve's fateful decision but offers his own knowledge of the sword that he overhead from the dwarves.
  Clarion call tell that sword has 2 enchantments. The first grants it power, and the second is a sealing enchantment that seems to seal some of its power away.
