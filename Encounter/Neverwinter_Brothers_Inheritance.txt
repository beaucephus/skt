====== Neverwinter Brothers Inheritance ======
Created Sunday 01 September 2019

If the party stays the night in [[:Noanar's Hold]]
they meet 3 middle-aged brothers from [[:Neverwinter]] who are gearing up for a night-time hill giant hunt.
Rantharl, Marthun, and Lezryk Daerivoss. They seem to speak a little louder and proudly when speaking their last names.
Each of the brothers is lavishly dressed in the finest high-quality, and highly-ornamented hunting gear.
They've __come to Noanar's hold to hunt hill giants, and we don't need or want any help.__
They seem competent enough and at dusk, strap on their rapiers, saddle up, and ride into the night.

If the party follows, the brothers are ambushed and killed by the huntlords.

If the party doesn't follow, the brothers return the next dawn, but Rantharl is not with them, and Marthun has a laceration on his right shoulder.
DC 11 medicine to discern it's from a rapier.

If asked, the remaining brothers claim that a hill giants great-spiked mace slew Rantharl
DC 15 Insight to discern this is a lie.


In fact, the brothers are playing a murderous game with their inheritance.
The agreement was simple: the brother who first deals the killing blow to a hill giant wins the inheritance of the other two.
Rantharl won the contest, but Marthun and Lezryk turned against him and slew him.

The 2 remaining brothers plan to set out again tonight to find another giant and settle the contest.
Of course 1 of them is going to kill the other.

The last brother returns to the Inn that night and plans to set off back to his __father's house in Neverwinter bearing the solemn news of my brother's death at the hands of marauding giants.__
The party could try to blackmail him for his inheritance (worth 10,000GP total)
