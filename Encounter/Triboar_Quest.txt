Created Sunday 02 June 2019

[[:Morak Ur'gray]] makes arrangements to deliver news of the giants' attack on [[:Nightstone]] to [[:Waterdeep]] 
He then reminisces on the death of his friend who died in the Dripping Caves, Darthag Ulgar.  He explains that Darthag owned and ran a franchise of the [[:Lionshield Coster]] in town. 
He then offers the party 2 diamonds (100gp each) if they will deliver Darthag Ulgar's remains and belongings to his next-of-kin, his ex-wife, Alaestra Ulgar, in [[:Triboar]]

!!!Remember the [[Item:Sanctified Bones]] !!!
The 2 diamonds are the ones in his chest. If the party opened or stole the chest, he blames the goblins, but expresses amazement that they were so thorough in their looting.
If the party doesn't reveal that they took the diamonds, Morak sighs and expresses regret that he couldn't offer them any reward, and pleads with them to do it for __the poor slain lad.__
