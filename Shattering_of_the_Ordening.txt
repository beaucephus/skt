====== Shattering of the Ordening ======
Created Sunday 29 March 2020

The ordening is a caste system ordained by [[:Anam the All-father]] , supreme god of all giant kind.

Anam is displeased with the giants of the material plane for their inaction against the recent rising of their mortal enemy, Tiamat.

Thus, Anam has shattered the previously ordained ordening and left the giants to find their own purpose.

Some giants have retreated into seclusion out of shame, some consort with the smaller races to better thrive, and some believe now it is their turn to lead all the other giants.
