====== Dral Thelev ======
Created Saturday 31 August 2019

The one-eyed half-orc proprietor of :Danivarr's House in [[:Everlund]]

__Dral's thin build and sharp attire contrasts his brutish, half-orc face, tusks, and missing eye.__
__A black monacle covers the scared divot where his eye once was.__
Dral speaks in a stately british drawl.

He is a member of the [[:Harpers]] and has a close bond to [[:Darathra Shendrel]] of [[:Triboar]]
If the party helped Darathra, Dral fills them in on the layout, locations, and politics of Everlund (see the everlund page)
