====== Shalamayne ======
Created Monday 03 June 2019

__This thick, heavy dwarven blade has a small cavity worked into he middle of the blade near the quillon.__
If an attuned creature grasps the grip, a flame ignites in the cavity, emitting dim light in a 10 foot radius. While within this light, Shalamayne's weilder and their allies are immune to the frightened condition. 

**In the hands of a dwarf or other creature attuned to a Belt of Dwarven Kind, or if the racial seal is released**
The once dim, encouraging flame, roars into a raging fire which licks up the blade's edge. Shalamayne deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on hit.

(If [[:Valriel]] gets the sword, do something later to cause her to make a decision, have the sword split)
