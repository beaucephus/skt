====== Fire Shield Loop ======
Created Monday 10 August 2020

When a creature attunes to the ring it __magically shrinks to fit that creature's index finger, and warm orange light spills from minuscule cracks that form on  its outer surface.__
The ring has 3 charges that can be spent to cast the Fire Shield spell (fire only)
Once the last charge is expended, the ring loses this spellcasting ability.
