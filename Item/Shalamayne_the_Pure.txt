====== Shalamayne the Pure ======
Created Sunday 09 August 2020

**In the hands of a dwarf or other creature attuned to a Belt of Dwarven Kind, or if the racial seal is released**
The once dim, encouraging flame, roars into a raging fire which licks up the blade's edge. Shalamayne deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on hit.

This thick, heavy dwarven blade has a small cavity worked into the blade near the quillon. When weilding Shalamayne, flame roars from the cavity, licking up the length of the blade and emitting dim light in a 30-foot radius. While within this light, you and your allies are immune to the frightened condition. Shalamayne deals an additional 2d6 fire damage.
