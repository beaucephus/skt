Requires attunement
Attunement involves 4 hours of focused practice at the end of which you must make a DC25 performance check. On a success, you are attuned. On a failure, you take 2d4 psychic damage, and remain NOT attuned.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast 1 of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it canâ€™t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the targets have Disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

**Spells**
Control Weather, Cure Wounds (5th level), Wall of Thorns
