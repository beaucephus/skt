====== Xantharl's Keep ======
Created Friday 13 March 2020

__This fortified keep and village stands in the middle of nowhere, high on a crag on a notoriously dangerous stretch of the Long Road.__
__An outer wall with heavy crossbows mounted to its battlements encloses a keep sheltered by a steep roof.__

Inside:
__Surrounding the keep are dozens of narrow stone houses with heavy shutters and steep roofs of their own.__
__Visible from both gates, a large inn and roadhouse with stables attached looms over the other smaller buildings in the village.__

===== Falling Orc Inn and Tavern =====
Inside the inn:
__The inside of the inn looks more like a barracks than a typical inn. Several dozen soldiers, unarmored, are sitting on long benches eating hard meat and drinking.__
__The soldiers outnumber the villagers here 2 to 1.__
__The barkeep, a hulking half-ogre, welcomes your group as you enter.__

The patron and barkeep of the inn is a half-ogre female named Arzastra
