====== Mirabar ======
Created Monday 16 March 2020

__The marble city of Mirabar sits atop a knoll on the north side fo the Mirar River like an unassailable fortress, enclosed on all sides by sloped outer walls as wide at the base as a city block.__
__Even the docks down by the river have battlements and fortifications.__

Inside the city:
__The population is mostly human.__
__Marked and labeled tunnel entrances dot the streets, leading further down into the earth beneath.__

Under the city:
__A second city thrives under the surface. Here you find most of the inhabitants are dwarven. Very few humans venture down here for more than a few hours at a time.__
__The underground is extremely hot and the air is heavy with smoke and ash.__

DC 10 (+5 per hour spent underground) CON save or gain exhaustion while under the city.
