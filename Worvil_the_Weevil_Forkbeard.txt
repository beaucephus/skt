====== Worvil the Weevil Forkbeard ======
Created Sunday 29 March 2020

Worvil and his crew were recently hired by [[:Frana Willowwhisper]] to assault a stone giant stronghold in the [[:GrayPeak Mountains]]

Worvil and his crew betrayed Frana and left her for the giants. Since then Worvil has been down on his luck and is hiding out in [[:Xantharl's Keep]]

Worvil knows he last saw [[:Frana Willowwhisper]] in the GrayPeak Mountains, though she must have escaped to execute this plan.
