Created Friday 05 July 2019

__A quiet village well known for its soft beds and rich ale.__
__A few walled farms and grazing sheep around the town.__
__A ruined keep hidden among the stand of trees west of the village.__

[[:Waterdeep]] keeps a __large contingent of city guards here__ using a __nearby barracks__ as a headquarters for __patrols up and down__ the [[:Long Road]] to [[:Amphail]] and [[:Waterdeep]]

[[Yondral Horn]] runs the local Inn, The [[:Sleeping Dragon]]
  Yondral is on the [[:Black Network]] 's payroll and has heard of the party.
  He offers them the finest rooms. They have thin walls and Yondral attempts to spy on the players.

Rassalanter's keep has largely been robbed of its stone to build other structures in the village, and its cellars and dungeons are waterlogged.
A hidden chamber in the dungeon holds a permanent teleportation circle.
The teleportation circle is used by the Blackstaff (Waterdeep's hightest-ranking wizard) to send messages and aid to Rassalantar
