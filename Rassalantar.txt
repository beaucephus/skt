====== Rassalantar ======
Created Friday 05 July 2019

A quiet village of soft beds and rich ale.
A few walled farms and grazing sheep around the town.
A ruined keep hidden among the stand of trees west of the village.

[[:Waterdeep]] keeps a large contingent of city guards here using a nearby barracks as a headquarters for patrols up and down the [[:Long Road]] to [[:Amphail]] and [[:Waterdeep]]

[[Yondral Horn]] runs the local Inn, The [[:Sleeping Dragon]]
  Yondral is on the [[:Black Network]] 's payroll and has heard of the party.
  He offers them the finest rooms. They have thin walls and Yondral attempts to spy on the players.

Rassalanter's keep has largely been robbed of its stone to build other structures in the village, and its cellars and dungeons are waterlogged.
A hidden chamber in the dungeon holds a permanent teleportation circle.
The teleportation circle is used by the Blackstaff (Waterdeep's hightest-ranking wizard) to send messages and aid to Rassalantar
